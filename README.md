# Topics Covered:
I went much more in depth into ArrayLists and how they work and how to specifically add values to an Array list that I may create.
I also went through some of the Object Oriented Programming module to go more in dept with Objects and how they are used.
The third topic that I went over more in depth was some of the encapsulation moldules that were provided in Codecademy.
